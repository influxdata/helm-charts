# I'm hoping that this means we only trigger a release
# when the push is to the master branch and a Chart.yaml was
# modified.
#
# We've found that automatically releasing on push to master alone
# causes a lot of problems, especially as we forget to encourage contributors
# to bump the version; even reminding them isn't a great experience.
#
# This should allow us to have a successful build without such a change
# and then manually update the Chart version ourselves, without build
# failures
