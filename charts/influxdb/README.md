# InfluxDB Helm chart

[InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb) is an open source time series database with no external dependencies. It's useful for recording metrics, events, and performing analytics.

The InfluxDB Helm chart uses the [Helm](https://helm.sh) package manager to bootstrap an InfluxDB StatefulSet and service on a [Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io) cluster.

> **Note:** ### If you're using the InfluxDB Enterprise Helm chart, check out [InfluxDB Enterprise Helm chart](https://github.com/influxdata/helm-charts/tree/master/charts/influxdb-enterprise).

## Prerequisites

- Helm v2 or later
- Kubernetes 1.4+
- (Optional) PersistentVolume (PV) provisioner support in the underlying infrastructure

## Install the chart

1. Add the InfluxData Helm repository:

   ```bash
   helm repo add influxdata https://helm.influxdata.com/
   ```

2. Run the following command, providing a name for your release:

   ```bash
   helm upgrade --install my-release influxdata/influxdb
   ```

   > **Tip**: `--install` can be shortened to `-i`.

   This command deploys InfluxDB on the Kubernetes cluster using the default configuration. To find parameters you can configure during installation, see [Configure the chart](#configure-the-chart).

   > **Tip**: To view all Helm chart releases, run `helm list`.

## Uninstall the chart

To uninstall the `my-release` deployment, use the following command:

```bash
helm uninstall my-release
```

This command removes all the Kubernetes components associated with the chart and deletes the release.

## Configure the chart

The following table lists configurable parameters, their descriptions, and their default values stored in `values.yaml`.

To configure the chart, do either of the following:

- Specify each parameter using the `--set key=value[,key=value]` argument to `helm upgrade --install`. For example:

  ```bash
  helm upgrade --install my-release \
    --set persistence.enabled=true,persistence.size=200Gi \
      influxdata/influxdb
  ```

  This command enables persistence and changes the size of the requested data volume to 200GB.

- Provide a YAML file that specifies the parameter values while installing the chart. For example, use the following command:

  ```bash
  helm upgrade --install my-release -f values.yaml influxdata/influxdb
  ```

  > **Tip**: Use the default [values.yaml](values.yaml).

For information about running InfluxDB in Docker, see the [full image documentation](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/).

## Persistence

The [InfluxDB](https://hub.docker.com/_/influxdb/) image stores data in the `/var/lib/influxdb` directory in the container.

If persistence is enabled, a [Persistent Volume](http://kubernetes.io/docs/user-guide/persistent-volumes/) associated with StatefulSet is provisioned. The volume is created using dynamic volume provisioning. In case of a disruption (for example, a node drain), Kubernetes ensures that the same volume is reattached to the Pod, preventing any data loss. However, when persistence is **not enabled**, InfluxDB data is stored in an empty directory, so if a Pod restarts, data is lost.

## Start with authentication

In `values.yaml`, change `.Values.config.http.auth-enabled` to `true`.

To handle this set up during startup, set `.Values.setDefaultUser.enabled` to `true`.

Make sure to uncomment or configure default user settings after enabling it. If a password is not set, a random password will be generated.

Alternatively, if `.Values.setDefaultUser.user.existingSecret` is set the user and password are obtained from an existing Secret, the expected keys are `influxdb-user` and `influxdb-password`. Use this variable if you need to check in the `values.yaml` in a repository to avoid exposing your secrets.

## Back up and restore

Before proceeding, please read [Backing up and restoring in InfluxDB OSS](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/administration/backup_and_restore/). While the chart offers backups by means of the [`backup-cronjob`](./templates/backup-cronjob.yaml), restores do not fall under the chart's scope today but can be achieved by one-off kubernetes jobs.

### Backups

When enabled, the[`backup-cronjob`](./templates/backup-cronjob.yaml) runs on the configured schedule. One can create a job from the backup cronjob on demand as follows:

```sh
kubectl create job --from=cronjobs/influxdb-backup influx-backup-$(date +%Y%m%d%H%M%S)
```

#### Backup Storage

The backup process consists of an init-container that writes the backup to a
local volume, which is by default an `emptyDir`, shared to the runtime container
which uploads the backup to the configured object store.

In order to avoid filling the node's disk space, it is recommended to set a sufficient
`ephemeral-storage` request or enable persistence, which allocates a PVC.

Furthermore, if no object store provider is available, one can simply use the
PVC as the final storage destination when `persistence` is enabled.

### Restores

It is up to the end user to configure their own one-off restore jobs. Below is just an example, which assumes that the backups are stored in GCS and that all dbs in the backup already exist and should be restored. It is to be used as a reference only; configure the init-container and the command and of the `influxdb-restore` container as well as both containers' resources to suit your needs.

At which point the data from the new `<db name>_bak` dbs would have to be side loaded into the original dbs.
Please see [InfluxDB documentation for more restore examples](https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v1.8/administration/backup_and_restore/#restore-examples).

## Mounting Extra Volumes

Extra volumes can be mounted by providing the `volumes` and `mountPoints` keys, consistent
with the behavior of other charts provided by Influxdata.

```yaml
volumes:
- name: ssl-cert-volume
  secret:
    secretName: secret-name
mountPoints:
- name: ssl-cert-volume
  mountPath: /etc/ssl/certs/selfsigned/
  readOnly: true
```

## Upgrading

### From < 1.0.0 To >= 1.0.0

Values `.Values.config.bind_address` and `.Values.exposeRpc` no longer exist. They have been replaced with `.Values.config.rpc.bind_address` and `.Values.config.rpc.enabled` respectively. Please adjust your values file accordingly.

### From < 1.5.0 to >= 2.0.0

The Kubernetes API change to support 1.160 may not be backwards compatible and may require the chart to be uninstalled in order to upgrade.  See [this issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6583) for some background.

### From < 3.0.0 to >= 3.0.0

Since version 3.0.0 this chart uses a StatefulSet instead of a Deployment. As part of this update the existing persistent volume (and all data) is deleted and a new one is created. Make sure to backup and restore the data manually.

### From < 4.0.0 to >= 4.0.0

Labels are changed in accordance with [Kubernetes recommended labels](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/common-labels/\#labels). This change also removes the ability to configure clusterIP value to avoid `Error: UPGRADE FAILED: failed to replace object: Service "my-influxdb" is invalid: spec.clusterIP: Invalid value: "": field is immutable` type errors. For more information on this error and why it's important to avoid this error, please see [this Github issue](https://github.com/helm/helm/issues/6378#issuecomment-582764215).

Due to the significance of the changes, we recommend uninstalling and reinstalling the chart (although the PVC shouldn't be deleted during this process, we highly recommended backing up your data beforehand).
